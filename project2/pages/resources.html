    <div><h3>Intersectionality</h3>
<p>The analytical framework for understanding the complexities that make up our world within individual unique experiences. Intersectionality includes all aspect of individual identities such as (but not limited to): race, gender, sexuality, social class, political background, physical/mental disabilities, and more.</p>
<blockquote>"In essence, however, intersectionality is 'a way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power.'" <br><span class="crenshaw">Kimberlé Crenshaw, 2015</span>
</blockquote>
<h4>Why is intersectionality important?</h4>
<p>Understanding intersectionality and the diverse backgrounds that create individuals allows us to recognize inequalities and the aspects of our culture that need meaningful change. This could be in our educations, work environments. </p>

<div class="implicit-section"><h3>Implicit Bias</h3>
<p>Implicit bias is an unconcious negative prejudice or attitude against a specific group. This could be in association with race, gender, and more. </p>
<h4>Implicit Bias Test</h4>
<p>The Implicit Bias Tests from Harvard measure the automatic associations between concepts with evaluations or stereotypes.</p>
<p class="before-ul">The options for tests include topics:</p>
<uL>
  <li>Race</li>
  <li>Transgender/Cisgender</li>
  <li>Jewish People/Judaism</li>
  <li>Gender-Career</li>
  <li>..and more!</li>

    <h4>Joy Buolamwini TED Talk – How I’m fighting bias in algorithms</h4>
    <p>Joy Buolamwini is a black, female computer scientist whose career shifted focus upon her graduate studies at MIT. She had faced issues throughout her academic and professional career related to racially biased facial recognition software. This sort of algorithmic bias dates to the first camera, and how lighting settings were adjusted for white, or fair-skinned people. Now, this bias has caused issues in so many aspects of our lives such as criminal justice and hiring practices. The more artificial intelligence software is used across industries, the larger the magnitude of what Joy calls the “coded gaze” is. Joy has started the <a href="https://www.ajl.org/" target="_blank">Algorithmic Justice League</a> a movement toward “equitable and accountable AI” with innumerous efforts to better these systems we so heavily rely on.</p>

 <h3>Intersectionality Resources</h3>
 <div class="inter-resource-resources">
    <div><h4>Intersectionality Resource Guide and Toolkit</h4>
<p>This comprehensive guide from the United Nations Women's organization dissects what intersectionality is, why it matters, what issues it is concerned with, how it is practiced, and much more. By just reading the introduction you will gain a comprehensive understanding of what the term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 2015, means greater than her initial definition of it as “a way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power” as it is much more than that. </p>

    <div><h4>Board Games To Fight Bias</h4>
<p>This short 4-minute NPR podcast explores how implicit bias affects people with all different intersecting identities – class, race, ethnicity, gender, etc. – however, they do this through using a group card game called ‘Buffalo’. The game was designed by a Dartmouth College research lab, Tiltfactor Lab. To hear an explanation of how the game tackles unconscious bias and challenging the biases we don’t even know we hold, give it a listen: </p>

    <div><h4>AI and Climate Justice: Balancing Risk With Opportunity</h4>
<p>This article outlines the impacts that large-scale artificial intelligence data centers have on surrounding environments and communities, especially in an age of exponentiated data consumption. To ensure ethical and sustainable guidelines within this technological era, the relationships between computers and our natural world must be researched and placed more importance upon.
