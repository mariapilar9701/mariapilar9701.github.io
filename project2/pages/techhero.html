    <h3>Mileyca Oporta</h3>
    <span class="sub-title">she/her</span>
<p>This tech hero is Mileyca Oporta, a Costa Rican female electronics engineer and tireless advocate for women in STEM: she’s passionate about aerospace engineering, promotes STEM education in underrepresented communities, is the President of the Society of Women Engineers Costa Rica, a trilingual professional, a second-generation immigrant, and a mother on top of it all. Not only was Mileyca a full-time student and worker but was raising a child on her own while figuring out what her organizational aspirations were. While trying to give her daughter a life full of opportunity, she realized she too had unfulfilled opportunity in her own life. Becoming a back-office assistant at 20 years old led her to discover engineering as a career path. Ever since, she has dedicated herself to learning more about the industry of aerospace engineering that she’s grown to love and advocates for those at a disadvantage in her field. She is an inspiration to all young women, and people who want to pursue a STEM career, or a career that others will tell them not to – whether it breaks antiquated racial or gendered societal standards or not. Mileyca overcame countless challenges and continues to prove her contribution to the engineering field every day by finding new opportunities to lead, teach, and advocate for others.</p>
