        This song expresses the idea of decreasing humanity with increasing technological reliance. 
        The sound is infused with classic R&B touches, modern techno beats, and has a moody, otherworldly feel to it. 
        This perfectly encapsulates how I feel while learning about the relationship between code and power in the 
        Library and Information Science course we've created this page for.

      <p>Hi! I come from a Mexican-American family, a home buzzing with driven, and creative individuals. I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My project partner Kyra and I have created this website as a resource to empower individuals to understand the relationship between computer science and human bias. My professional direction fuses research experience from the Social and Moral Learning Lab with a growing focus on community empowerment, advocacy, developmental psychology, research, sustainability, and technology. My academic path, including study abroad coursework in culture, history and sustainability, reflect a profound interest in how psychology research can provide innovative changes in art, culture, and technology. At the convergence of human rights and environmental equity, I bring a unique cognitive-behavioral perspective to the improvement of our communities. </p>

      <p>Hello! I am junior in the Information Sciences major, but I have previously gotten my
associate’s degree in Web &amp; Digital Media Design from the Milwaukee Area Technical
College. After I got my associate’s degree, I worked as a software engineer at Foxconn
Industrial Internet for a few years. At Foxconn, I got to work on smart warehouse
solutions as the SAP EWM team lead. I even had the opportunity to travel around the
USA and some parts of Mexico to see chip and server manufacturing factories for major
companies like Amazon, LG, and Seagate. After working at Foxconn, I switched to a
specifically front-end developer role with Milwaukee’s RoofMarketplace.
<br>
Outside of work, I love hiking, camping, spending time in nature in general.
Unfortunately, since I HATE winter, you’ll find me behind my computer gaming or
exploring the internet as soon as the temperature drops below 40. I would hibernate if I
could… I have a million micro-hobbies of pretty much every kind of art and crafts from
sewing to painting to junk journalling. I think it’s so much fun to try new mediums.</p>
